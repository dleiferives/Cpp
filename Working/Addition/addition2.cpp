// By Dylan Leifer-Ives 7-25-2020: 21:13 A different way to write an adition script. Wanna see if it works
#include <stdio.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
	int x;
	int y;
	int z;

		
	std::cin >> x;
	std::cin >> y;
	
	z = x+y;
	std::cout << z;
//finished 21:16
//21:17-8 or not forgot to declare z and make print work with an escape character.
// For sure was not done, just learned some stuff and decied to go with cout like usual 21:28
