Ok so this is one of those simple ass ones right, so we want and input 

out << how long do you want your result?
in >> len

int seed;
int m = some shit.
int a = Chungus number (could use pi for fun?);
int b = less chungo number;
out << we want seed
in >> seed

int random_number_seed

random_number_seed = (( seed * a ) + b ) % m 

seed = random_number_seed


and then from there we can do more stuff I think
